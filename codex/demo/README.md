22-11-2025

just created a simple up that shows us two datas 
1 - when we click on the home icons it shows us the names of the user .
2 - when we click on the notification icon it shows the age of the users .

i created this to understand how bottomnavigation bar works on real system with the help of bottom navigation bar we can
create a bottom icons and using that icons we set a states on that to see how the ui react when we click on that icon.
